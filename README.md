# My Blog!

Blog built using React and deployed on Github Pages. 
This is currently under development.

#### Status :- 
  - Boilerplate code deployed
  - Changes successfully deployed

#### References :- 
  - https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/

#### Future Work :- 
  - Add content
  - Make this into an actual blog
  - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-and-googlesheets/

#### How to deploy changes:-
In the local directory, make the appropriate changes in the files, and then run `npm run deploy`.
This pushes and updates the code in the `gh-pages` branch.

#### Master branch
Pushing code to the master branch is optional but good for consistency in my opinion. Push using `git push origin master`.

If changes were made in some other place (like from the github website like I am right now), you can either force push using the -f flag i.e. `git push -f origin master`, or,

merge using `git pull origin master`
